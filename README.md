# ft_transcendence for 42cursus.

This project is about creating a website where users will play Pong and chat with others.

We chose NestJS for the backend, React for the frontend and Prisma for the database.

We seperated the project in 3 main parts :
- authentication ([@Rudyar](https://github.com/Rudyar))
- game ([@lleveque42](https://github.com/lleveque42))
- chat ([@ADNASLIDEV](https://github.com/ADNASLIDEV))

:warning: You won't be able to use this website as you need 42Paris api keys. This is only for explanation purposes. :warning:

You will instantly find a match if someone is already waiting in the queue. Otherwise, you will have to wait for someone to join. <br>
Once a match is found, you will be directed on the map selection page where you can choose the map you want to play on.

If you and your opponend choose the same map, you will play on that map. Otherwise, the map will be randomly selected from the two choices. <br>
The game will be hosted by the player who joined the game first.
A 3 seconds countdown will start and the match will begin. <br>
