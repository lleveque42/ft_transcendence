# ft_transcendence for 42cursus.

This project is about creating a website where users will play Pong and chat with others.

We chose NestJS for the backend, React for the frontend and Prisma for the database.

We seperated the project in 3 main parts :
- authentication ([@Rudyar](https://github.com/Rudyar))
- game ([@lleveque42](https://github.com/lleveque42))
- chat ([@ADNASLIDEV](https://github.com/ADNASLIDEV))
